mod basics {
    // tuple structs are hybrid data type between structs and tuples

    // unit like structs are little bit different from tuple structs.
    // they are empty structs in fact.
    /*
    Unit structs are only useful as trait objects.
    Why should i use this?
    For instance, a library may ask you to create a structure that implements a certain trait to
    handle events. If you donâ€™t have any data you need to store in the structure, you can create a
    unit-like struct.
