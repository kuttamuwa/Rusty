/*
Constants and immutable static variables might seem similar, but a subtle difference is that values
in a static variable have a fixed address in memory. Using the value will always access the same data.

Constants, on the other hand, are allowed to duplicate their data whenever theyâ€™re used.

Another difference between constants and static variables is that static variables can be mutable.
Accessing and modifying mutable static variables is unsafe.
